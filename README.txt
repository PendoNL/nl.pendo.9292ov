This app brings Dutch public transport information from 9292 right into your smart home automations. It lets you set up triggers based on real-time departure data. So you could, for example, turn on your hallway lights or send yourself a notification when your train or bus is about to leave. The app supports any station in the Netherlands and can filter by specific destinations.

Beyond triggers, you can also use conditions to check things like "is the next departure delayed by more than 5 minutes?" or actions to fetch departure details into your flow.
